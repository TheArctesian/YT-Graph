# Plan

Google Captions API

## UI
- Figure out how to sort 
- Gamers
    - Horrer, MOBA, Sandbox...
        - Sub cat each game
But i don't really care about that 


Can do linear, nLP adapt daddy bayes
Aim is veritasim but hopfully an abillity to automate
So need a NLP subject classifaction algo
- Need to revist daddy bayes
    Don't want to make specfic algos for each one, there is broad classifaction algos
## NLP splitter 
This is kinda superflous if i can find out how to get tags for each video
1. Parse data 
2. Sep into catagories
